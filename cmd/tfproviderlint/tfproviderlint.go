// The tfproviderlint command is a static checker for Terraform Providers.
//
// Each analyzer flag name is preceded by the analyzer name: -NAME.flag.
// In addition, the -NAME flag itself controls whether the
// diagnostics of that analyzer are displayed. (A disabled analyzer may yet
// be run if it is required by some other analyzer that is enabled.)
